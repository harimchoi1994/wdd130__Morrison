      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>This website is designed to help customers order pizza made of Zucchini 
        crust, apply for jobs, show deals and upcoming additions to the menu, 
        and to advertize for the hypothetical company I will one day start of 
        the same name.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This website is specifically designed to help people who are dieting and 
        still want to enjoy pizza. the Zucchini crust that I make is both healthy
        and delicious, and this is coming from someone that can't stand zucchini. 
        So anyone that enjoys pizza but doesn't want to sacrifice their health 
        goals can order from here without losing the great flavor of their favorite 
        pizza.</p>  <!-- change this -->
